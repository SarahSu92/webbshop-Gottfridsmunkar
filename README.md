# A brief description about this project.
Project Title "Gottfrids Munkar Onlinebutik"
This project is a onepage webbshop. The products for sale is donuts and the minimum product amount was 10. 

The page has not much CSS to celebrate about because I was focusing more on JavaScript and that was also the main focus for this assignment. 
The products have a image, price, rating, category and name. They are also avaible to sort in a sorted list. Also buttons for increase and decrease the products amount.

The cart show the added products and amount, price for each dount but also the total amount is shown, also added shipment price and a few special rules that are replied, if
the cutomer order 10 donuts of same sort they get a dsicount 10% of the price. Also on fridays after 15 pm and on the night between sunday to monday the custumoer get a weekend price
added 15% on the current price. No notificatiion about it just higher pricer in the cart. 

At the bottom of the page we have a form to collect and validate order information and how to pay, either with card or invoice as option, though invoice is only avalible if amount is below
800 kr. Otherwise it cant be choosed as a option in the form if the price amount is over 800 kr in the cart. When the order is validated and have been send a orderconfirmation accurs below
the form to show the date of the order and shipment details, price and so on. If the customer takes to long though, over 15 minutes to complete the form validation an alert pops up that informs
the customer that it has taken to long to complete and the form has been restored. 

Images of the page below, also a ligthouse rapport.
